## Arrays in Javascript

## Overview

Arrays in JavaScript are ordered collections used to store multiple values in a single variable. They are dynamic, can hold elements of any type, and provide many built-in methods to manipulate the data efficiently.

## Creating Arrays

Arrays can be created using square brackets `[]` with elements separated by commas.

## Accessing Items

- Array elements are accessed by their zero-based index.
- The first element is at index `0`.
- The last element is at index `array.length - 1`.
- Accessing an index outside the array length returns `undefined`.

## Common Array Methods

### push()

Adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length.

### pop()

Removes the last element from an array and returns that element.

### indexOf()

Returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or `-1` if it is not present.

### includes()

Checks if an array contains a certain element and returns `true` or `false`

# Loops in JavaScript - Example Overview

This project demonstrates various types of loops in JavaScript, providing clear examples to help you understand how each loop works and when to use them.

## Overview of Loop Types

## For Loop

The `for` loop is used to run a block of code a specific number of times. It is ideal when you know in advance how many iterations you want to perform.

## While Loop

The `while` loop continues to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. It is useful when the number of iterations depends on dynamic conditions.

## Do-While Loop

The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it guarantees that the code block runs at least once before the condition is tested.

## For...of Loop

The `for...of` loop is designed to iterate over iterable objects such as arrays, making it easy to access each element directly.

## For...in Loop

The `for...in` loop iterates over the enumerable properties of an object, allowing you to access keys and their corresponding values.

## forEach Loop

The `forEach` method executes a provided function once for each element in an array, offering a clean and functional approach to array iteration.

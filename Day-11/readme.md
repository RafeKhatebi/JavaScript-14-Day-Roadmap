This README explains some common JavaScript array methods: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `forEach`, with simple descriptions and an example.

## Methods Overview

* **map:**
  Creates a new array by applying a function to each element of an existing array.
* **filter:**
  Creates a new array containing only elements that meet a specified condition.
* **reduce:**
  Reduces an array to a single value by applying a function to each element (from left to right).
* **forEach:**
  Executes a function on each element of an array (does not create a new array).

# JavaScript Objects 

This project demonstrates different ways to create and manipulate objects in JavaScript. It covers object creation methods, property access, modification, addition, and deletion.

## Object Creation Methods:

## Object Literal Notation

The most common and straightforward way to create an object is by using object literal notation. This method allows you to define properties and methods directly within curly braces.

## Using the `new Object()` Constructor

Objects can also be created using the built-in `Object` constructor. This approach involves creating an empty object first and then adding properties to it.

## Using `Object.create()`

Another method to create objects is by using `Object.create()`, which allows you to create a new object with a specified prototype. This is useful for inheritance and prototype-based programming.

## Working with Object Properties

## Accessing Properties

Object properties can be accessed using dot notation or bracket notation. This lets you retrieve values stored within the object.

## Adding Properties

You can dynamically add new properties to an existing object at any time after its creation.

## Modifying Properties

Existing properties of an object can be updated or changed to reflect new values.

## Deleting Properties

Properties can be removed from an object using the `delete` operator, which permanently removes the specified key and its value.

## Object Methods

Objects can contain functions as properties, known as methods. These methods can access and manipulate the object's own properties using the `this` keyword, enabling encapsulated behavior

# JavaScript Functions

## Overview

Functions in JavaScript are blocks of code designed to perform particular tasks. They are one of the main building blocks of a program, allowing code reuse without repetition. Functions can be defined in several ways and can accept parameters and return values.

## Types of Functions

### 1. Function Declaration

A named function defined with the `function` keyword. It can be called before it is defined due to hoisting.

### 2. Function Expression

A function assigned to a variable. It can be anonymous or named. Not hoisted.

### 3. Arrow Functions

A concise syntax for anonymous functions, with implicit return for single expressions.

### 4. Function Constructor

Functions can also be created using the `Function` constructor, though this is rarely used.

## Parameters and Arguments

- **Parameters** are variables listed in the function definition.
- **Arguments** are the actual values passed to the function when called.

## Return Values

Functions can return values using the `return` statement. If no return is specified, the function returns `undefined`.

## Functions as First-Class Objects

In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, meaning they can be:

- Assigned to variables
- Passed as arguments to other functions
- Returned from functions

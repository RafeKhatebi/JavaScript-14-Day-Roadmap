### Conditional Statements

Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.

You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

1. Use **if**  to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
2. Use **else** to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
3. Use **else if** to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
4. Use **switch** to specify **many alternative blocks** of code to be executed
